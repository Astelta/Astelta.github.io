            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Last updated: October 14, 2024</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Astelta! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our Discord bot named "Human"
                (the "Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The Bot collects and stores only the Discord user ID of users who interact with it. This data is used
                solely for the purpose of assigning resources in the in-game economic system. We do not collect any
                other personal information or data.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>Discord user IDs are stored to track your progress and manage resources in the economic game. This
                information is not shared with third parties, and it is used solely for gameplay purposes within the
                Bot.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your Discord user ID is securely stored in our database. We take reasonable measures to protect this data
                from unauthorized access, but no system is completely secure. By using the Bot, you acknowledge that we
                cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>

            <h2>5. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the
                top of this page. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for any changes. Your
                continued use of the Bot constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at <a
                    href="https://discord.gg/sjvPCsQDgv"> our help discord server</a>.</p>
